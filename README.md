# Portfolio

This is a project for my personal portfolio website, it's currently functional and mostly done, but some parts may still be subject to change.

It requires portfolio's strapi application in order to run. Locally, you may run it with production configuration (or change the API URL in `src/environment/environment.ts`) in order to connect to the production API.

### Tests

The application does contain unit tests for some components. They can be run with:
```bash
ng test
```
